## hx711 Micropython driver

This is the beginnings of a Micropython driver for the HX711 Weighing Sensor!
Early days yet, started with the help of [this MicroPython forum thread](https://forum.micropython.org/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=2678).

Features:
- Prints some broken values from a hx711 sensor!

TODO:
- Everything :)
